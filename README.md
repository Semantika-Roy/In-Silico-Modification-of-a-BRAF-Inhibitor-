# In-Silico-Modification-of-a-BRAF-Inhibitor
#Objective
This project focuses on the in silico modification of the FDA-approved drug Dabrafenib, which targets the BRAF V600E mutation—a common driver in melanoma. The aim is to enhance Dabrafenib’s binding affinity, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties while minimizing toxicity and off-target effects. By editing the ligand structure and analyzing ADMET and toxicity profiles, the project seeks to optimize the drug for improved therapeutic efficacy and resistance management.

Background
The BRAF V600E mutation results in continuous activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, contributing to uncontrolled cell proliferation in melanoma. Although Dabrafenib is effective, resistance often develops, necessitating the optimization of its molecular structure. Through computational ligand editing and predictive analysis, this project provides a streamlined workflow to improve drug performance without experimental synthesis.

Tools and Resources Used
ChemSketch – For ligand editing
SwissADME – ADMET profile prediction
Protox II – Oral toxicity and toxicological endpoint prediction
MolView / Avogadro / PyMOL – Molecular visualization
PyRx – Molecular docking 

Conclusion
This in silico study demonstrates a computational strategy to optimize an existing therapeutic agent, Dabrafenib, targeting the BRAF V600E mutation. The modified structures showed improved pharmacokinetic profiles and reduced predicted toxicity, supporting their potential as more effective melanoma treatments. These findings lay the groundwork for further in vitro and in vivo validation.
